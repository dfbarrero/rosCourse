# Closed-loop odometry-based robot motion control

## Objectives

1.- Understand the concept Finite-State Machine (FSM) and implement a simple one.

2.- Implement a closed-loop robot controller.

3.- Implement a realistic robot motion controller more precise than the previous assignment.

## Prerequisites

Install the following ROS packages:

* stdr_simulator
* stdr_resources
* stdr_gui
* stdr_robot

Download the [launch file](simple_room.launch), which contains the scenario for this assignment. Verify that you can correctly run the launch file with roslaunch.

## Finite-State Machines

A Finite-State Machine (os simply FSM) is an abstract machine that models its behaviour in a set of finite states. Here "state" stands for the intuitive concept that we have of state. For instance, a person may be in state "running", or "jumping" or "walking" or "idle". One important aspect about a FSM is that the transicion among its states is controlled, usually, by a set of events, so if the FSM is in a certain state, it only can transate to a limited set of states. In this way the FSM is an excellent tool to model behaviours. This feature along with the extreme ease of its implementation makes FSM a tool of choice in a great number of applications (from Robotics to Videogames, just to mention two).

A very convenient way to represent FSM is throgh a directed graph in which the states are represented by circles and the transitions among states with directed edges. The initial state is usually represented with a double circle and there is also a final state.

Where s_i means state i and E_j means event j.

The implementation of a FSM is straightforward. A na√Øve implementation can use a variable to store the current state and a if-elseif or switch-case statement to assess the state and implement the logic associated with it. 

~~~Python
state = "MOVING"
...
if state == "MOVING":
	# Analize event
	# Execute actions in this state
	# Change to next state (if needed)
	state = "IDLE"
elif state == "IDLE":
	# Analize event
	# Execute actions in this state
	# Change to next state (if needed)
	state = "MOVING"
~~~

Much more complex can be used in case the number of states were high, or FSMs that can change in time. For us the simple implementation previously shown makes our job.

Finite-State Machines are widely studied in a Mathematics and Computer Science field named Automata Theory, and has a deep impact in Computation. 

## Practical assignment

The goal to achieve in this assignment is the same one that the previous assignment, "Basic robot motion control with Rospy". Given the robot placed in the map shown below, move it from its initial location on point A to the point B. In this case we will use a more elaborated mechanism to control the robot motion based on a FSM and odometry.

To this end, perform the following tasks:

1.- Create a new ROS package named `fsm_controller`.

2.- Create a subfolder `launch` and move the [launch file](motion/simple_room.launch) file to that folder.

4.- Implement a Python node named `fsm_controller` which implements the motion control based on the odometry. To this end the node must listen to messages of type `geometry_msgs/Point` reaching the topic `/motion`. The message must contain a vector with the distance that the robot must move in form `(x,0,0)` or `(y,0,0)`. Ignore the z-component of the vector. When a message arrives, the controller must store the initial odometry value and move the robot to the desired direction (always on x or y, never mixed) until the odometry indicates that the objective has been achieved. Use the FSM defined in the next figure to handle the robot states.

The robot may stay in one of the following states:

* *idle*: The robot is stopped waiting for commands.

* *MOVING_NORTH*: It represents that the robot is moving north. The robot enters in this state when a message with the form `(y,0,0)` arrives to the topic `/motion`. White the robot is in the state `MOVING_NORTH` throws away any message received in the topic `/motion`.

* *MOVING_SOUTH*: It represents that the robot is moving south. The robot enters in this state when a message with the form `(-y,0,0)` arrives to the topic `/motion`. White the robot is in the state `MOVING_SOUTH` throws away any message received in the topic `/motion`.

* *MOVING_WEST*: It represents that the robot is moving west. The robot enters in this state when a message with the form `(x,0,0)` arrives to the topic `/motion`. White the robot is in the state `MOVING_WEST` throws away any message received in the topic `/motion`.

* *MOVING_EAST*: It represents that the robot is moving east. The robot enters in this state when a message with the form `(-x,0,0)` arrives to the topic `/motion`. White the robot is in the state `MOVING_EAST` throws away any message received in the topic `/motion`.

5.- Implement the logic needed to move the robot from A to B.
